This code provides a solution to develop an AI system that uses natural language processing to generate high-quality markdown code documentation for any given software project. It includes the following functions:

1. `extract_functions`: This function takes a file path as input and extracts information about each function in the codebase. It returns a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains the function name, parameters, docstring, and usage examples.

2. `extract_examples`: This function extracts usage examples for a given function. It takes the entire code content and the line number of the function definition as input. It returns a list of usage examples.

3. `generate_markdown_documentation`: This function generates markdown documentation for a given software project. It takes a file path as input and uses the `extract_functions` function to extract function information. It then formats the information into markdown and returns the final documentation as a string.

To use this code, you need to provide the file path to the `generate_markdown_documentation` function. It will analyze the codebase, extract relevant information, and generate markdown output that includes function descriptions, parameter details, and usage examples.

## AI Code Review Assistant

### Introduction
The AI-based code review assistant is designed to help developers identify potential issues and improvements in their code. It analyzes code repositories, detects common coding patterns, and provides actionable suggestions for code optimization, security enhancements, and best practices. The assistant aims to improve code quality, maintainability, and efficiency.

### Code Optimization Recommendations

#### 1. Use Appropriate Data Structures
Consider using appropriate data structures to optimize performance and memory usage. For example, use dictionaries for fast key-value lookups, lists for sequential access, and sets for efficient membership testing.

```python
# Recommendation: Use a dictionary for faster lookup
employee_data = {
    "John": 25,
    "Jane": 30,
    "Mark": 28
}
```

#### 2. Avoid Unnecessary Loops
Avoid unnecessary loops that can impact performance. Instead, use built-in functions or list comprehensions for concise and efficient code.

```python
# Recommendation: Use list comprehension for concise code
squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
```

#### 3. Optimize Database Queries
Optimize database queries by minimizing the number of queries and reducing data transfer. Use query optimization techniques like indexing and caching.

```python
# Recommendation: Use database indexing for faster queries
CREATE INDEX idx_employee_name ON employee (name);
```

### Security Enhancement Recommendations

#### 1. Prevent SQL Injection Attacks
To prevent SQL injection attacks, use parameterized queries or prepared statements instead of concatenating user input directly into SQL queries.

```python
# Recommendation: Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = %s", (username,))
```

#### 2. Validate User Input
Always validate and sanitize user input to prevent security vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. Use libraries or frameworks that provide built-in input validation mechanisms.

```python
# Recommendation: Sanitize user input to prevent XSS attacks
import bleach

user_input = "<script>alert('XSS');</script>"
sanitized_input = bleach.clean(user_input)
```

#### 3. Implement Access Control Mechanisms
Implement access control mechanisms to enforce proper authorization and authentication. Use role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC) to restrict unauthorized access.

```python
# Recommendation: Implement RBAC for access control
if user.role == "admin":
    # Allow admin actions
```

### Best Practice Recommendations

#### 1. Follow Coding Conventions
Follow coding conventions and style guidelines to ensure consistency and readability. Use linters or code formatters to automatically enforce coding standards.

```python
# Recommendation: Follow PEP 8 coding conventions
def calculate_total(a, b):
    return a + b
```

#### 2. Write Unit Tests
Write unit tests to validate the correctness of your code and catch potential bugs early. Use testing frameworks like pytest or unittest to automate the testing process.

```python
# Recommendation: Write unit tests to validate code functionality
def test_calculate_total():
    assert calculate_total(2, 3) == 5
    assert calculate_total(0, 0) == 0
```

#### 3. Document Your Code
Document your code using descriptive comments and docstrings to improve code maintainability. Use tools like Sphinx or Doxygen to generate code documentation from docstrings.

```python
# Recommendation: Document code using docstrings
def calculate_total(a, b):
    """
    Calculate the sum of two numbers.

    Args:
        a (int): First number.
        b (int): Second number.

    Returns:
        int: Sum of the two numbers.
    """
    return a + b
```

### Conclusion
The AI code review assistant provides recommendations for code optimization, security enhancements, and best practices. By following these recommendations, developers can improve the quality, security, and maintainability of their code.
