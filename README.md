This code provides a solution to develop an AI system that uses natural language processing to generate high-quality markdown code documentation for any given software project. It includes the following functions:

1. `extract_functions`: This function takes a file path as input and extracts information about each function in the codebase. It returns a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains the function name, parameters, docstring, and usage examples.

2. `extract_examples`: This function extracts usage examples for a given function. It takes the entire code content and the line number of the function definition as input. It returns a list of usage examples.

3. `generate_markdown_documentation`: This function generates markdown documentation for a given software project. It takes a file path as input and uses the `extract_functions` function to extract function information. It then formats the information into markdown and returns the final documentation as a string.

To use this code, you need to provide the file path to the `generate_markdown_documentation` function. It will analyze the codebase, extract relevant information, and generate markdown output that includes function descriptions, parameter details, and usage examples.
